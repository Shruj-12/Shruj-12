# Hi there 👋
## I'm Srujan N. Gandhi

Student exploring computer science and engineering, building practical projects and learning how technology solves real-world problems. Focused on growing my skills and turning ideas into useful tools.

🔭 I’m currently working on writing scripts that allow me to find prime numbers and visualize them. I enjoy making practical solutions, however, this was an interesting math and programming challenge for myself.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and C. I also want to get into backend development (SQL databases and AWS cloud services) and powerful languages like C++, Java, and Swift.
